# Bank Data Classification

Bank Data Classification is a machine learning project that focuses on classifies bank data for three features: customer acquisition, customer retention, and loan prediction. The goal is to develop models that can accurately classify new bank data.

## Features

The project takes into account the following main features for classification:

1. Customer Acquisition: This feature focuses on identifying potential customers who are likely to join the bank based on their demographics, income level, credit history, etc.

2. Customer Retention: This feature aims to predict whether existing customers are likely to continue their relationship with the bank. It considers factors such as customer activity, account history, and satisfaction levels.

3. Loan Prediction: This feature focuses on predicting whether a customer is eligible for a loan based on their financial information, credit score, employment status, etc.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

Several machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated for this project. The chosen algorithms for each category are as follows:

- Customer Acquisition: C4.5 decision tree algorithm was selected for its ability to handle both numerical and categorical data, making it suitable for customer acquisition classification.

- Customer Retention and Loan Prediction: Random Forest algorithm was chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships and provide accurate predictions in scenarios with multiple input features.

## Web Application

The Bank Data Classification project includes a web application built using the Python Django framework.

## Getting Started
